### Project Overview: Airflow ETL Pipeline with Postgres and API Integration
This project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts data from an external API (in this case, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API), transforms the data, and loads it into a Postgres database. The entire workflow is orchestrated by Airflow, a platform that allows scheduling, monitoring, and managing workflows.

The project leverages Docker to run Airflow and Postgres as services, ensuring an isolated and reproducible environment. We also utilize Airflow hooks and operators to handle the ETL process efficiently.

Key Components of the Project:
Airflow for Orchestration:

Airflow is used to define, schedule, and monitor the entire ETL pipeline. It manages task dependencies, ensuring that the process runs sequentially and reliably.
The Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines the workflow, which includes tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Postgres Database:
